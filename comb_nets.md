## Combine different nets

To combine two different nets, start dragging the connection between two pins with different nets, and FreePcb-2 itself will offer to combine them. If you want to combine several nets at once, then you need to go to the main menu Project-> Combine Nets and in the dialog box you will need to select the nets, and then enter the name of the new net.
