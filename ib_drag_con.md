While dragging a connection, hovering the mouse over various pins, you can browse the net of these pins through Infobox. Go to the PINS tab and reset the filter by pressing the R button in the upper right corner of the InfoBox window. Now select the pin on the circuit board, and then press the F2 Connect To Pin button to start dragging the connection. When you mouse over any pin, Infobox will display the net of this pin. To clear the Infobox, click on an empty spot on the circuit board or press the R button. You can also jump to any pin in the drag and drop mode by double-clicking on the Infobox list.
