`Today you can try the debug version of the Schematic Constructor v1.0.`

[Freepcb v2.033 + Schematic Constructor v1.0](https://yadi.sk/d/Nh0Ed17JoSJpxQ)

You will need a template [https://yadi.sk/d/qdvMUxP3zTs7Ng](https://yadi.sk/d/qdvMUxP3zTs7Ng)

And also an example project [https://yadi.sk/d/Vj5IGg3eiUmIig](https://yadi.sk/d/Vj5IGg3eiUmIig)

copying a simple timer circuit (video) [https://yadi.sk/d/gpLG3yCwHGxxcw](https://yadi.sk/d/gpLG3yCwHGxxcw)
