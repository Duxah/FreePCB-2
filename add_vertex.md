## You can add a vertex to the copper route segment. 

When the segment is highlighted, click `F3_Add_Vertex`, and an extra vertex will be added. Left click in the place where you want to place it.

_Good to know: if the segment width is thin, then clicking the mouse cursor by the segment vertex is quite difficult. You can select the vertex with the mouse selection frame, it usually turns out easier and faster_
