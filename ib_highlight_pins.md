### How to highlight pins from Infobox

Go to the PINS tab of Infobox.

Filter the required pins. In this example, we will highlight the first pins of all the details. To do this, enter the string %.1 in the pin name console. Now right click and select 'Highlight All'.

If you want vias in addition to the pins in the infobox list (for example, to view the diameters of all the holes on the printed circuit board) then in the settings menu you need to check the box 'Show Vias'
