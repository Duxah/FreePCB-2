We have a node of three segments. To understand where the trace is and where the branch click on any segment and press T on the keyboard. The trace or branch will be fully highlighted. If the track goes from pin to pin, then this is the trace.

And this is a branch, since it ends on a node of another route or branch.

To turn the top segment of a trace into a branch, first create an additional vertex on it.

Now the trace looks like this:
