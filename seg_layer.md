## You can change the segment layer.

When a segment is highlighted, press `F2_Change_Layer`. Or with the `SHIFT` button held down, press the layer number and the segment will be transferred to this layer. By the way, looking ahead, we can say that with the SHIFT button the copper area can also be transferred to another layer.
