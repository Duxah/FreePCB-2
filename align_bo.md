You can align the polyline node in the X, Y-coordinate of any other vertex or pin. First click on the vertex with the target coordinates, and then click on the vertex of the polyline you want to move. Now you need to select the axis: F7 = X F8 = Y. It is also possible to set the position of the node between any two vertices or pins. Or between the top of the copper region and the pin. Any combination. To do this, first click on the first element, then on the second element, and then on the element that you want to shift. Then select the menu F5 - Align Between. A new menu will open where you can select the appropriate alignment.
