### auto positioning of parts

To position a group of 3 to 15 parts whose pins have common nets, first select them on the board, and then press the F5_Part_Auto_Pos button. Press the button several times to select the best option, since the next time you click, the algorithm changes and the parts may take a different location. You can also turn off the visibility of a net (for example GND) through the Project -> Nets main menu, and then try again. In this case, this net will not be taken into account, and the parts will most likely also take a different position.
